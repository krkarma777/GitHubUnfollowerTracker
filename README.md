# GitHubUnfollowerTracker

## Project Description

GitHubUnfollowerTracker is a sleek, web-based application that enables users to effectively manage and monitor their GitHub social connections. Leveraging the GitHub API, it provides real-time insights into follower dynamics, allowing users to identify who has unfollowed them and manage their following list more efficiently. This tool is built using Kotlin and Spring Boot, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Version 2 Release Notes

#### New Features
- **Whitelist Management**: Users can now specify a whitelist of usernames to exempt from the unfollow process. This is done through a new input field in the Unfollow Users form, which supports comma-separated usernames.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implemented asynchronous processing using Kotlin coroutines. This update includes:
  - **kotlinx-coroutines-core dependency**: Added for asynchronous processing capabilities.
  - **kotlinx-coroutines-reactor dependency**: Supports integration with Reactor for combining reactive programming with coroutines.
  - **Refactored `unfollowUser`**: Now utilizes coroutines to handle asynchronous execution, improving performance when processing multiple unfollow requests simultaneously.

#### Enhancements
- **Optimized Follower Filtering Logic**: Improved the logic for filtering followers in the unfollow endpoint, enhancing efficiency and response times.
- **Enhanced Code Documentation**: Updated and expanded the code documentation for the `GitHubController`, making it easier to understand and maintain.

#### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced the stability and performance of the follower management tools.
- Improved error handling for rate limit issues with GitHub's API.

### Known Issues
- No major issues reported in this release. Users experiencing any difficulties should report them for immediate review.

#### Upgrade Notes
- Users are encouraged to update to the latest version to take advantage of the new features and improvements.
